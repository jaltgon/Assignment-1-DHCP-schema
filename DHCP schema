# Assignment-1-DHCP-schema
Based on the following premises, create the (server1/client/server2) schema for DHCP service requests: 

A new user joins a network. We assume the network has 2 DHCP servers. 

    -The user sits at their machine and turns on their computer. 
    -They work for 1 hour connected to DHCP server #1. 
    -The user experiences a 3-minute outage. The user reconnects to -the network after 3 minutes. Server #1 is down. 
    -The user remains active for 12 hours. 
    -The user disconnects for 1 hour. 
    -The user reconnects to the network. 
    -The user stays on the network for 5 hours and then disconnects permanently 

(*). We assume that our DHCP server operates with average lease times (8 hours).
